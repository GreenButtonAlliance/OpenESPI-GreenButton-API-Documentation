  Welcome to Green Button Developer</h3>

<p>The Green Button API provides flexible access to Energy Usage
Information through a set of RESTful interfaces. These APIs provide access to
Green Button resources.</p>

<p>Green Button uses the <a href="http://www.odata.org"><span style="color:blue;">Open Data(OData)</span></a>
standardized protocol for creating and consuming data APIs. OData
builds on core protocols like HTTP and commonly accepted methodologies
like REST. This results in a uniform way to expose full-featured data APIs.
Green Button utilizes OData and the ATOM Publishing standard 
to encapsulate Energy Usage Information.</p>

<p>Green Button uses <a href="API">RESTful APIs</a> to provide
standard access to information for metered resources such as
electricity, gas, and water. These interfaces may be used to access and
manage the metered data by using atom+xml based streams of Energy
Usage Information (EUI) encapsulated within an Atom Feed. The tabs
above allow you to explore more deeply into the Green Button API by
reviewing example API calls.</p>

<p>Green Button allows data to be exchanged between Utilities, Customers, and Third Party Services Providers. It uses standard (http) based messaging to accomplish these exchanges. So, starting with the Green Button Actors:
<dl>
<dt>RetailCustomer</dt>

<dd>Any person or enterprise that is provided services such as
electricity, water, or gas from a resource service provider.
RetailCustomers may be residential, commercial, or industrial.</dd>

<dt>DataCustodian</dt>

<dd>Any enterprise that is holding metered data obtained during the
course of providing resources to a <em>RetailCustomer</em>. A <em>DataCustodian</em>
holds that data as part of the service they provide and may, with the authorization of the
RetailCustomer, allow that data to be shared with a third party.</dd>


<dt>ThirdParty</dt>
<dd>Any person or enterprise that is authorized to have access to metered data held by a <em>DataCustodian</em>.  A <em>ThirdParty</em>, when authorized, may <em>subscribe</em> to a <em>RetailCustomer's</em> data and provide additional services as desired.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Relationships Amoungst the Actors</h3>
<p>The Actors enter into relationships as depicted in the diagram above. The simplest relationship is the one that exists between the DataCustodian (i.e. the Utility) and their customer (the <em>RetailCustomer</em>). This relationship allows the <em>RetailCustomer</em> to download a file that contains their resource usage information. This simple relationship is the basis for the <a href="#download-my-data">Green Button Download My Data</a> operation.
