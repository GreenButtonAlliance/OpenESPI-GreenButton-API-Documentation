  <dt>Download My Data</dt>
  <dd>A RetailCustomer may download an XML file from either a Data
  Custodian or a Third Party. Restful interfaces are provided to
  enable this operation. There are no assumptions made with respect to
  what the RetailCustomer might do with this XML file, although best
  practices would be to insure the file is viewable by using a minimal
  stylesheet.

  <dt>Connect My Data</dt>

  <dd>The RetailCustomer may also authorize Green Button data to move
  between two machines, such as from their utility to a company that
  might use the data to estimate the energy efficiency of their
  facility. In this case, <em>Connect My Data</em> would be used to
  provide machine-2-machine data transfers. Connect My Data may provide
  a single transfer of information, or transfers on a predefined
  schedule.
